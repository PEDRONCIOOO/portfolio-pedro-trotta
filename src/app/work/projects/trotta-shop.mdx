## Overview

Trotta Shop (https://trotta.shop) is a high-performance e-commerce platform specializing in premium vaping products, pods, and nicotine salts, serving customers worldwide. The platform was built from the ground up using TypeScript and Next.js to create a seamless shopping experience that prioritizes speed, security, and conversion optimization.

The project required building a robust e-commerce solution capable of handling international shipping regulations, multi-currency payments, and a complex product catalog with multiple variants and customization options, all while maintaining exceptional performance across global markets.

## Key Features

- **Internationalized Shopping Experience**: Implemented full i18n support for 12 languages with region-specific pricing, shipping options, and age verification flows compliant with local regulations.

- **Optimized Product Discovery**: Created an advanced filtering system with instant search capabilities powered by Algolia, allowing customers to find products by brand, flavor profile, nicotine strength, and compatibility.

- **Performant Mobile-First Design**: Built a responsive UI that delivers sub-500ms page loads on mobile devices through aggressive image optimization, code splitting, and Next.js's static generation capabilities.

- **Seamless Checkout Process**: Designed a streamlined, single-page checkout with smart default selection, address validation, and persistent cart functionality that resulted in a 42% reduction in cart abandonment.

- **Advanced Inventory Management**: Developed a real-time inventory tracking system that synchronizes across multiple warehouses to provide accurate stock information and automated reordering.

- **Customer Account Portal**: Created a personalized dashboard where customers can track orders, manage subscriptions, view purchase history, and receive personalized product recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Used throughout the codebase for type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering, static generation, and API routes
- **React Query**: For efficient data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Stripe & PayPal**: For secure payment processing with multi-currency support
- **Prisma**: For type-safe database access with PostgreSQL
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive styling with a custom design system
- **Vercel**: For global deployment with edge functions and image optimization
- **Sanity.io**: For headless CMS to manage product catalog and content
- **Algolia**: For lightning-fast search functionality

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was balancing the complex regulatory requirements for vaping products across different countries with a seamless user experience. We implemented a sophisticated geolocation system that dynamically adjusts product availability, messaging, and checkout requirements based on shipping destination.

Another significant hurdle was optimizing the image-heavy product catalog for global performance. We solved this through an automated image processing pipeline that creates multiple formats and resolutions, then serves them conditionally based on the user's device and connection speed.

The project also taught valuable lessons about A/B testing in e-commerce. By implementing a robust testing framework, we were able to incrementally improve conversion rates through data-driven design decisions rather than assumptions.

## Outcome

Since its launch, Trotta Shop has achieved:

- 35% higher conversion rate than industry average
- 2.5x revenue growth year-over-year
- Expansion to serving customers in 45+ countries
- 99.98% uptime even during flash sales and peak shopping periods
- Average page load time of 1.2 seconds globally

The TypeScript-first approach has allowed for rapid feature development with minimal bugs in production, while Next.js provides the performance foundation that keeps bounce rates low and SEO rankings high. The platform continues to evolve with new features and optimizations, maintaining its position as a leader in the global vaping e-commerce space.
