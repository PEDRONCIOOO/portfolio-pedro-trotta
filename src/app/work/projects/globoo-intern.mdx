## Overview

We’re developing a robust and secure internal banking management system tailored for the operational needs of Globoo.io—a growing tech company with ambitious scalability goals. This system is designed to handle critical financial operations, user management, access control, and data auditing, while ensuring a seamless developer experience and secure architecture.

Our goal is to create a centralized, reliable, and scalable solution that can serve as the core infrastructure for managing sensitive financial data and workflows, with security and developer efficiency at its core.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Built a flexible microfrontend structure using TypeScript and Next.js, making it easy to scale and maintain independent modules (e.g., account management, transaction history, user access control).
- **Security-First Design**: Implemented strict role-based access control (RBAC), encrypted communication layers, and audit logging to track all system activity in compliance with internal policies and industry standards..
- **TypeScript-Driven Development**: The entire codebase, from front-end to back-end services, is written in TypeScript. This ensures strong type safety, predictable behavior, and a smooth DX (developer experience).
- **Internal API Gateway**: A centralized API layer handles all interactions between microservices, secured with token-based authentication and built with Express and tRPC.
- **Custom UI System**: Designed and developed a custom design system using React, styled-components, and Figma, focusing on accessibility and consistency. The system is documented using Storybook and powered by design tokens for easy theming.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Integrated WebSocket support for transaction logs and administrative dashboards, ensuring that data stays fresh and responsive without manual refreshes.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Core language across all services and apps for type safety and maintainability.
- **Next.js**: For rendering performant React apps with server-side capabilities.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **tRPC & Express**: For building fully-typed, secure APIs.
- **MongoDB**: As the main relational database, with strict role-based access and encryption.
- **Redis & WebSockets**: For session caching and real-time functionality.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was aligning security requirements with the need for fast internal development. We solved this by creating reusable abstractions around sensitive operations, alongside robust access control patterns. Another learning was optimizing collaboration between engineering and design, which we tackled through shared Figma libraries and token-based theming, ensuring our UI matched branding while remaining developer-friendly.

We also embraced type safety at scale—by using TypeScript across both frontend and backend, we minimized runtime errors and sped up team onboarding and collaboration.

## Outcome

The internal banking system is now used daily by Globoo.io teams across finance, ops, and engineering. It’s helped standardize workflows, increase the security posture of our internal tools, and drastically reduce redundant development time.

This project is now a core pillar of Globoo.io’s infrastructure, and we’re continuously evolving it to match our scaling needs and security standards. With the incredible support of my team, we’ve laid the foundation for a platform that will grow with the company for years to come.
