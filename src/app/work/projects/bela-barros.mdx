## Overview

The **Bela Barros Website it was made to receive about 5,6k messages weekly from fans and voters.

## Key Features

- **Automated UI Components**: Developed a system to auto-generate React components based on design files, minimizing manual work.
- **Real-Time Design Updates**: Integrated a process to sync Figma updates directly into the codebase, ensuring instant reflection of design changes.
- **Optimized Performance**: Applied advanced caching and lazy loading techniques to improve page speed and overall performance.
- **E-Commerce Focused Features**: Implemented product carousels, dynamic pricing, and a streamlined checkout process to enhance the user experience.
- **Scalability & Maintainability**: Designed a flexible architecture that allows seamless addition of new features without breaking existing functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma API**: Extracted design tokens and component data to automate front-end development.
- **React.js**: Built a modular and scalable component-based UI for maintainability.
- **Styled-Components**: Used for dynamic styling and theme management.
- **Node.js & Express**: Provided a backend structure to support dynamic content rendering.
- **GraphQL**: Enabled efficient data fetching and optimized state management.
- **GitHub Actions & CI/CD**: Automated build, testing, and deployment processes for streamlined development.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Maintaining Code Quality**: Ensuring the automatically generated React code followed best practices and was easy to maintain.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: Addressing various screen sizes, complex interactions, and ensuring proper responsiveness.
- **Error Handling in Automation**: Implemented robust logging and fallback mechanisms to prevent pipeline failures.
- **Design Consistency**: Ensured that design updates did not introduce unintended UI regressions by implementing visual regression testing.

## Outcome

The automated Figma-to-code pipeline has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by **40%**. Designers now have more confidence that their work will be accurately reflected in the final product, while developers can focus on more complex business logic and feature development. This project has demonstrated how automation can significantly enhance productivity and bridge the gap between design and development.
