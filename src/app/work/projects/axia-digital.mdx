## Overview

Axia Digital Solutions is a blockchain-focused startup building whitelabel financial infrastructure for the Brazilian market. The platform connects traditional banking (PIX, transfers, bill payments) with crypto ecosystems (wallets, exchanges, tokenization) through a modular architecture that clients can deploy under their own brand.

The core value proposition: take a financial business and give them the tech stack to operate digital banking, crypto trading, and asset tokenization—all from one integrated platform.
